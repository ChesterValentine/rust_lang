# Description
Simply a skeleton of a Rust program

# How it works

## Install
Don't forget to go at this page : https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install to install rustup on your computer.
If you are on Windows, you have to install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2017 

## Run it
To run that skeleton (it's just a Hello World! program), put that command on your terminal/cmd/powershell
```bash
cargo build name_of_your_file.rs
```
Cargo is the package manager of Rust. And with that command, cargo will download all dependencies that you put in the Cargo.toml file.
